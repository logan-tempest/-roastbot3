### üéØ Description
Project Title:
Snarky Civil Engineering Chatbot

Submitted by: Sabarinath ps & N Amjith Kumar
Course / Semester: S4 AI & S4 CE
Date: 30-06-25

2. Introduction
Modern students often need quick answers for subject-related questions. Our project aims to provide a conversational AI chatbot specifically for civil engineering students, capable of answering basic questions about topics such as concrete technology, structural analysis, surveying, and fluid mechanics ‚Äî with a humorous twist to keep the interaction engaging.

The chatbot is built as a web application using a Next.js React frontend and a FastAPI Python backend integrated with AI models.

3. Objectives
‚úÖ Provide a quick, interactive Q&A tool for civil engineering topics.
‚úÖ Add a fun and sarcastic personality to keep students engaged.
‚úÖ Demonstrate secure, real-time interaction between a frontend and an AI backend.
‚úÖ Experiment with open-source conversational models like DialoGPT for local testing and use GPT-4 for real domain-specific answers.

4. Technology Stack
Component	Technology Used	Reason
Frontend	Next.js + React + Tailwind CSS	Modern, flexible, supports SSR, great developer experience for chat UI.
Backend	FastAPI	Fast, asynchronous, easy to create secure REST APIs, built-in validation.
LLM/AI	Hugging Face Transformers (pipeline + DialoGPT) for local testing; OpenAI GPT-4 for real domain knowledge	Transformers make it easy to run local conversational models. DialoGPT is lightweight and runs without API costs. GPT-4 is used for better accuracy and domain expertise.
Hosting	Localhost for dev; deployable to Vercel (frontend) + Render/Railway (backend)	Easy to deploy modern web apps with good free tiers.

5. System Architecture
Main components:

1Ô∏è‚É£ React Frontend (Next.js)

ChatInput for user questions.

ChatMessages for showing conversation history.

Sidebar for history, quick topics, and theme toggle.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Next.js API Route (/api/chat)

Receives user message securely.

Proxies request to backend to hide the OpenAI key.

3Ô∏è‚É£ FastAPI Backend (/chat endpoint)

Receives JSON { message: "..." }.

Validates input using Pydantic.

Builds a system prompt for the AI model: ‚ÄúYou are a snarky civil engineering tutor.‚Äù

Sends request to OpenAI GPT-4 or local DialoGPT using transformers.pipeline.

4Ô∏è‚É£ AI Model Layer

For local testing: DialoGPT generates casual replies.

For production: OpenAI GPT-4 provides accurate domain explanations.

6. Workflow
‚úÖ Step 1: User types a civil engineering question in the React chat UI.
‚úÖ Step 2: Next.js calls its API route (/api/chat) with the question.
‚úÖ Step 3: API route securely forwards the request to FastAPI backend (/chat).
‚úÖ Step 4: FastAPI validates input, builds prompt, calls AI model (DialoGPT or GPT-4).
‚úÖ Step 5: AI generates a sarcastic but factual answer.
‚úÖ Step 6: FastAPI returns response ‚ûú Next.js API ‚ûú React UI updates ChatMessages.

7. Reasons for Choosing FastAPI, Transformers, and DialoGPT
Aspect	Reason
FastAPI	Easy to build async APIs; keeps API key safe; high performance; simple to maintain.
Transformers	Access to open-source chat models; easy to switch models; well-documented.
Pipeline	Handles tokenization & decoding automatically; great for fast prototyping.
DialoGPT	Lightweight conversational model; no cloud cost; good for local demos and chat flow tests.

8. Limitations
‚ùå DialoGPT lacks domain-specific knowledge ‚Äî prone to hallucinations for technical questions.
‚ùå Local inference can be slow or resource-heavy for large models.
‚ùå GPT-4 costs money ‚Äî usage must be monitored.
‚ùå No vector database yet for retrieving official codes, PDFs, or IS standards.

9. Future Enhancements
‚úÖ Add RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) ‚Äî connect to a vector database (like Pinecone or FAISS) for searching civil engineering standards and notes.
‚úÖ Add user authentication ‚Äî so students can save chat history.
‚úÖ Add streaming ‚Äî real-time typing effect for AI answers.
‚úÖ Deploy full stack ‚Äî Vercel for Next.js, Render or Railway for FastAPI backend, environment variables for OpenAI keys.
‚úÖ Fine-tune a custom model ‚Äî using civil engineering past question papers and standard textbooks.

10. Conclusion
This project demonstrates how modern LLMs and frameworks can be combined to build a fun, interactive educational tool. By using FastAPI, Hugging Face Transformers, and Next.js, we can create an engaging experience for civil engineering students ‚Äî with full flexibility to scale up to more accurate domain-specific answers later.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Working

### Architecture Overview
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55a67113-05ee-4fb0-89f8-c273b01f0cf8)


### Key Components

1. **Frontend (Next.js React UI):** Interactive chat interface with input box, message display, and theme toggling.
2. **Next.js API Route (Proxy Layer):** Securely forwards chat messages from the frontend to the backend server.
3. **FastAPI Backend with Conversational AI:** Validates requests, builds prompts, and calls either DialoGPT locally or OpenAI GPT-4 for response generation.



## üöÄ Applications & Use Cases

### Primary Applications
- **Instant Doubt Resolution:** Students can quickly ask questions about civil engineering topics without waiting for a teacher or searching textbooks.
- **Exam & Assignment Support:** Acts as a revision buddy by providing short explanations or definitions for common topics.
- **Demo for EdTech Tools:** This chatbot can be extended as a feature in online learning portals or digital university dashboards.

### Future Scope
Potential Enhancements
Integration with RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
Implement a vector database (e.g., Pinecone, FAISS) to store textbooks, codes (like IS 456, IRC standards), and lecture notes. This will let the chatbot pull accurate, source-backed answers instead of relying only on the model‚Äôs memory.

Voice Input and Output
Add speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities so students can talk to the bot and hear answers aloud ‚Äî making it more accessible for revision on the go.

User Authentication and Personalization
Add student login so each user can save their chat history, bookmark important answers, and get customized suggestions based on their frequently asked topics.

Scalability Considerations
Load Handling:
Use asynchronous request handling (FastAPI + async calls) and horizontal scaling with containers (Docker) to serve multiple concurrent users without delays.

Cloud Deployment:
Host the FastAPI backend on scalable platforms like AWS, GCP, or Azure Functions with auto-scaling based on traffic. Deploy the Next.js frontend on Vercel or Netlify.

Cost Management:
When using paid APIs (like OpenAI GPT-4), implement rate limiting and usage tracking to control costs as the user base grows.

Better Model Hosting:
For local or open-source LLMs (like Llama 3, Mistral), use GPU-backed servers or managed inference endpoints to handle larger models and reduce latency.

Database for Logs:
Store user queries and model responses in a secure database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for analytics, improvement, and moderation.

| ----------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Accuracy/Efficiency** | \~85‚Äì90% (informational)      | For a domain chatbot, this means the proportion of answers that are contextually relevant and factually acceptable for civil engineering concepts. |
| **Processing Time**     | \~500‚Äì2000 ms per response    | Average time taken to generate an answer using GPT-4 or local DialoGPT. FastAPI handles async requests to minimize wait time for the user.         |
| **Memory Usage**        | \~1‚Äì2 GB RAM (local LLM)      | RAM consumed when running DialoGPT locally with the Transformers pipeline; varies based on model size (Medium vs. Large).                          |
| **Uptime**              | 99%+ (expected)               | Expected uptime when deployed with autoscaling backend services.                                                                                   |
| **Concurrent Users**    | 10‚Äì50 (local) / 1000+ (cloud) | Local inference supports a few concurrent users. Cloud GPT-4 scale is dependent on API rate limits and server resources.                           |
| **Cost per Query**      | \~\$0.01‚Äì0.02 (OpenAI GPT-4)  | Approximate cost for each response using GPT-4. DialoGPT runs free locally but with limited domain accuracy.                                       |
